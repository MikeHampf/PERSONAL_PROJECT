# PERSONAL_PROJECT: Music + History

## If you're a musician prepping for a concert, recital, or evan an audition, Music + History can give your performance an extra dimension. With Music + History you can:

- Track what works you're preparing by title AND composer
- Retrieve biographical information about listed composers
- View additional composers from related musical eras
- Add randomly selected works from a listed composer for performance, prep, or just listening
- PLUS HISTORY! Every composer is viewed with historical highlights from the year of their birth for research, context, and/or presentation
